\textit{proof:}\text{ let } U \subseteq V \text{ where U is some invariant vector space with basis vectors } u_1, ...u_j\text{, for every } u\in U, T(u)\in U\text{ as }U\text{ is invariant}\\

\textit{Lima:}\textbf{ Subspaces of invariant subspaces are also invariant:}\\

\text{Let there be some subspace of }U, \text{called }W\\

\text{As }w\in U\text{ it follows that }Tw\in U\text{ Proving that any and therefore all subspaces of an invariant subspaces are also invariant}
